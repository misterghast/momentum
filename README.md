# momentum
Momentum is mod for Minecraft that is intended to give an additional tool to the player when dealing with multiple enemies at once in the form of a combo system.

It does this by increasing the amount of damage players do based on how many enemies they kill in a short period.

The mod will ultimately be very configurable and is intended for modpack creators.
